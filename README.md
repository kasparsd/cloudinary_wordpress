# Cloudinary's WordPress Plugin

Cloudinary is a cloud service that offers a solution to a web application's entire image and video management pipeline. 
With Cloudinary, all your images are automatically uploaded, normalized, optimized and backed-up in the cloud instead of being hosted on your servers.

With Cloudinary, you can stop messing around with image editors. Cloudinary can manipulate and transform your images online, on-the-fly, directly from your WordPress console. Enhance your images using every possible filter and effect you can think of. All manipulations are done in the cloud using super-powerful hardware, and all resulting images are cached, optimized (smushed and more) and delivered via a lightning fast content delivery network (CDN).

## WordPress Plugin

The plugin is available for installation via WordPress plugins directory.

## Development

### Create a Plugin Release Package

Run `npm run package` to create the plugin release in the `/build` directory and package it as `cloudinary-image-management-and-manipulation-in-the-cloud-cdn.zip` in the root directory.

Files included in the release package are defined in the `gruntfile.js` under the `copy` task. Be sure to update this list of files and directories when you add new files to the project.

### Deployment to WordPress.org

1. Tag a release from the `master` branch on GitHub.

2. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy the version referenced in the `cloudinary.php` file of the current branch.

3. Run `npm run deploy-assets` to deploy just the WP.org plugin assets such as screenshots, icons and banners.
